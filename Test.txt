She could hear the dead man coming up the steps. The
slow, measured sound of footsteps went before him,
echoing amongst the purple pillars of her hall. Daenerys
Targaryen awaited him upon the ebon bench that she had
made her throne. Her eyes were soft with sleep, her silvergold hair all tousled.
“Your Grace,” said Ser Barristan Selmy, the lord
commander of her Queensguard, “there is no need for you
to see this.”
“He died for me.” Dany clutched her lion pelt to her chest.
Underneath, a sheer white linen tunic covered her to
midthigh. She had been dreaming of a house with a red
door when Missandei woke her. There had been no time to
dress.
“Khaleesi,” whispered Irri, “you must not touch the dead
man. It is bad luck to touch the dead.”
“Unless you killed them yourself.” Jhiqui was biggerboned than Irri, with wide hips and heavy breasts. “That is
known.”
$
“It is known,” Irri agreed.
Dothraki were wise where horses were concerned, but
could be utter fools about much else. They are only girls,besides. Her handmaids were of an age with her—women
grown to look at them, with their black hair, copper skin,
and almond-shaped eyes, but girls all the same. They had
been given to her when she wed Khal Drogo. It was Drogo
who had given her the pelt she wore, the head and hide of a
hrakkar, the white lion of the Dothraki sea. It was too big for
her and had a musty smell, but it made her feel as if her
sun-and-stars was still near her.
Grey Worm appeared atop the steps first, a torch in hand.
His bronze cap was crested with three spikes. Behind him
followed four of his Unsullied, bearing the dead man on
their shoulders. Their caps had only one spike each, and
their faces showed so little they might have been cast of
bronze as well. They laid the corpse down at her feet. Ser
Barristan pulled back the bloodstained shroud. Grey Worm
lowered the torch, so she might see.
$
The dead man’s face was smooth and hairless, though
his cheeks had been slashed open ear to ear. He had been
a tall man, blue-eyed and fair of face. Some child of Lys or
Old Volantis, snatched off a ship by corsairs and sold into
bondage in red Astapor. Though his eyes were open, it
was his wounds that wept. There were more wounds than
she could count.
“Your Grace,” Ser Barristan said, “there was a harpy
drawn on the bricks in the alley where he was found …”
“… drawn in blood.” Daenerys knew the way of it by now.
The Sons of the Harpy did their butchery by night, and over
each kill they left their mark. “Grey Worm, why was this man
alone? Had he no partner?” By her command, when theUnsullied walked the streets of Meereen by night they
always walked in pairs.
“My queen,” replied the captain, “your servant Stalwart
Shield had no duty last night. He had gone to a … a certain
place … to drink, and have companionship.”
“A certain place? What do you mean?”
“A house of pleasure, Your Grace.”
$
A brothel. Half of her freedmen were from Yunkai, where
the Wise Masters had been famed for training bedslaves.
The way of the seven sighs. Brothels had sprouted up like
mushrooms all over Meereen. It is all they know. They
need to survive. Food was more costly every day, whilst
the price of flesh grew cheaper. In the poorer districts
between the stepped pyramids of Meereen’s slaver
nobility, there were brothels catering to every conceivable
erotic taste, she knew. Even so … “What could a eunuch
hope to find in a brothel?”
“Even those who lack a man’s parts may still have a
man’s heart, Your Grace,” said Grey Worm. “This one has
been told that your servant Stalwart Shield sometimes gave
coin to the women of the brothels to lie with him and hold
him.”
The blood of the dragon does not weep. “Stalwart
Shield,” she said, dry-eyed. “That was his name?”
“If it please Your Grace.”
“It is a fine name.” The Good Masters of Astapor had not
allowed their slave soldiers even names. Some of her
Unsullied reclaimed their birth names after she had freed
them; others chose new names for themselves. “Is it knownhow many attackers fell upon Stalwart Shield?”
“This one does not know. Many.”
$
“Six or more,” said Ser Barristan. “From the look of his
wounds, they swarmed him from all sides. He was found
with an empty scabbard. It may be that he wounded some
of his attackers.”
Dany said a silent prayer that somewhere one of the
Harpy’s Sons was dying even now, clutching at his belly
and writhing in pain. “Why did they cut open his cheeks like
that?”
“Gracious queen,” said Grey Worm, “his killers had forced
the genitals of a goat down the throat of your servant
Stalwart Shield. This one removed them before bringing
him here.”
They could not feed him his own genitals. The Astapori
left him neither root nor stem. “The Sons grow bolder,”
Dany observed. Until now, they had limited their attacks to
unarmed freedmen, cutting them down in the streets or
breaking into their homes under the cover of darkness to
murder them in their beds. “This is the first of my soldiers
they have slain.”
“The first,” Ser Barristan warned, “but not the last.”
I am still at war, Dany realized, only now I am fighting
shadows. She had hoped for a respite from the killing, for
some time to build and heal.
$
Shrugging off the lion pelt, she knelt beside the corpse
and closed the dead man’s eyes, ignoring Jhiqui’s gasp.
“Stalwart Shield shall not be forgotten. Have him washed
and dressed for battle and bury him with cap and shieldand spears.”
“It shall be as Your Grace commands,” said Grey Worm.
“Send men to the Temple of the Graces and ask if any
man has come to the Blue Graces with a sword wound.
And spread the word that we will pay good gold for the
short sword of Stalwart Shield. Inquire of the butchers and
the herdsmen, and learn who has been gelding goats of
late.” Perhaps some goatherd would confess. “Henceforth,
no man of mine walks alone after dark.”
“These ones shall obey.”
Daenerys pushed her hair back. “Find these cowards for
me. Find them, so that I might teach the Harpy’s Sons what
it means to wake the dragon.”
Grey Worm saluted her. His Unsullied closed the shroud
once more, lifted the dead man onto their shoulders, and
bore him from the hall. Ser Barristan Selmy remained
behind. His hair was white, and there were crow’s-feet at
the corners of his pale blue eyes. Yet his back was still unbent, and the years had not yet robbed him of his skill at
arms. “Your Grace,” he said, “I fear your eunuchs are ill
suited for the tasks you set them.”
Dany settled on her bench and wrapped her pelt about
her shoulders once again. “The Unsullied are my finest
warriors.”
$
“Soldiers, not warriors, if it please Your Grace. They were
made for the battlefield, to stand shoulder to shoulder
behind their shields with their spears thrust out before them.
Their training teaches them to obey, fearlessly, perfectly,
without thought or hesitation … not to unravel secrets or ask
